The idea of this file is to start putting scenarios together to test the engine
in various scenarios. Hopefully this will lead to a far more stable system that
does not create unexpected behaviour when our in the wild.

## Tested

## Untested
Make sure sprite sheets work.
Use incorrect correct number of variables for any interop function.
Use invalid asset_id.
Load corrupted or wrong file types into asset manager.
