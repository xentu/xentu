Classes
=======

Xentu implements a number of classes that can be used in your game code:

|

The Color Class
===============

The colou class is a mechanism that allows you to specify and manipulate Color
values using modern techniques, such as hexidecimal notation, CMYK, alpha values
and HSL transformation.

|

The Font Class
==============

The font class provides a mechanism for telling the engine which sprite font to
use when rendering text.

|

The Scene Class
===============

The scene class is a mechanism for wrapping together game logic, asset loading
draw calls & properties that all belong to one part of your game. A scene could
be a menu screen, or a single game level, or a score board, or an intro video.

|

The Shader Class
================

The shader class is a mechanism that allows you to tell the engine which shading
technique the graphics card should use. You create these by loading a shader via
the asset manager.

|

The Sprite Class
================

The sprite class provides a mechanism for telling the engine which part of a 
texture to render, and where to render it on the screen.
