The Scene class
===============

The scene class wraps together game logic, asset loading draw calls & properties
that all belong to one part of your game. A scene could be a menu screen, or a
single game level, or a score board, or an intro video.

For an example on how to use the scene class in your game. See :ref:`game.set_scene(scene)`
