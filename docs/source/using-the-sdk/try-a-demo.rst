==========
Try A Demo
==========

Xentu SDK includes a number of demo games to get you started. Lets try one now
by entering the following command into the console:

.. code-block:: shell

	xentusdk demo brick-breaker

Doing this will copy the files from the demo game brick-breaker into the folder
you are currently navigating with the console. If you open the folder in your
file browser, you'll see that there are now several files, including the main
required file ``game.lua``.

Back to our console lets give the game a go by entering the command:

.. code-block:: shell

	xentusdk play

.. admonition:: Be Adventurous!
	:class: important

	Try editing files in the folder you are in (hint hint ``game.lua``) then
	running the ``xentu play`` command again. Here's some things you
	could try:
	
	- Changing which keys are used to move the board. 
	- Make the speed of the ball increase over time.
	- Pick a different sound for when a brick is broken.

	Tweaking and playing with game code is the heart and soul of Xentu, so please
	change it, upgrade it, break it, customise it, and most importantly have fun!
	
	If you get stuck, check out the :ref:`Lua Code Reference` to see how to do
	things.
