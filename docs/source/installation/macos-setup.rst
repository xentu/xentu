MacOS Installer
---------------

If you wish to install the SDK the most traditional way, you can `download the
Xentu SDK here <https://xentu.net/download>`_ which provides a makeself .run script that
installs all the nessisary components onto your system.

|

Make Sure It Works! (MacOS)
---------------------------

Open a command line console or terminal, and enter the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    xentusdk version

If all goes well you should get a message telling you which version you have
installed.

|

If You Need To Uninstall
------------------------

If for some reason you need to uninstall, there currently is no GUI way of doing
this. However no permenant settings are changed when you run the installer. So if
you wish to remove the SDK. Delete the folder **/usr/local/share/xentusdk** and
you should be sorted.
