Debian Installer
----------------

If you wish to install the SDK the most traditional way, you can `download the
Xentu SDK here <https://xentu.net/download>`_ which provides a DEB package that
installs all the nessisary components.

Make Sure It Works! (Linux/FreeBSD)
-----------------------------------

Open a command line console or terminal, and enter the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    xentusdk version

If all goes well you should get a message telling you which version you have
installed.

|

If You Need To Uninstall
------------------------

The .deb file you download registers with the package manager in your OS when
you install. So you should navigate to the software manager, and look for installed
apps. There you will find the Xentu SDK, and it should allow you to remove if
needed.
