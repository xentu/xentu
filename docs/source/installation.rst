Creating your first game using Xentu is very easy, and can be done on nearly any
modern computer. To get started you will need a copy of the Xentu SDK (Software
Development Kit) installed on your computer.

The SDK is a small program that enables tools that can be accessed using your
chosen command line console or terminal. The tools provided include: creating

share with others.

So let's get stuck in! Pick the operating system you are using below, and follow
the instructions to get started;
