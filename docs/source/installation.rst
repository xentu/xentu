Installation
============

To get started with Xentu, you will need a copy of the SDK installed on your
computer. The SDK (Software Development Kit) bundles a copy of the engine, demos,
libraries and tools that can be access through your command line console or
terminal of choice. The SDK allows you to do the following:

1. Create new computer games.
2. Debug the games you create.
3. Play the games you and others create.
4. Package your created games so that you can share with others.
5. Check for SDK updates.

Pick the operating system you are using below, and follow the instructions to
